# GoldenDark Speedrun Sidebar (GeSSA 2)
This project is a replacement of [GeSSA](https://github.com/LostMyTriforce/gessa/).


### The application is currently in development and is not ready yet.
---

GoldenDark is an OBS browser element that displays level data and your times to your viewers when speedrunning the games Perfect Dark & GoldenEye. The sidebar is intergated into the app (the controller) and can be configured to your needs.

### A more user friendly layout.
GoldenDark has a more sleeker and modern looking UI. There's less of the clutter and more consitency and customisability.

### One controller, every device.
If you run a studio where someone else will manage your sidebar, or if you use a separate machine for elements, GoldenDark allows you to broadcast the controller to your home network so you can use your sidebar anywhere.[^1]

### Redesigned from the ground up.
GoldenDark is more optimised under the hood to help keep the app running smoother than ever. It's even smaller in size!

### GE and PD in one application.
You can now change between GoldenEye and Perfect Dark at will, depending on which game you're speed running. You can even change which edition of GoldenEye you're running, and what system you're playing on.

### Easier Management for your data.
GoldenDark will allow you to manage your level and application data easily.

### Effective against the defective.
GoldenDark automatically backs up and checks for issue with your save data where your times are stored. It will also replace corrupted files where necessary.

### GoldenDark Online
See the grind times of other GoldenDark users, interact with them and sync your data across other instances of GoldenDark that you're logged into.[^2]

And much more!

[^1]: Your sidebar will be visible to people on your home network if they know your device IP and port number for the controller. Internet users cannot see this. Nobody can alter your sidebar data.
[^2]: GoldenDark Online won't be available on GoldenDark's inital release.
