# GoldenDark Speedrun Sidebar
This project is a replacement of [GeSSA](https://github.com/LostMyTriforce/gessa/).

GDSS is an OBS browser element that displays level data and your times to your viewers when speedrunning the games Perfect Dark & GoldenEye. The sidebar is intergated into the app (the controller) and can be configured to your needs.

### A more user friendly layout.
GDSS has a more sleeker and modern looking UI. There's less of the clutter and more consitency and customisability.

### Redesigned from the ground up.
GDSS is more optimised under the hood to help keep the app running smoother than ever. It's even smaller in size!

### GE and PD in one application.
You can now change between GoldenEye and Perfect Dark at will, depending on which game you're speed running. You can even change which edition of GoldenEye you're running, and what system you're playing on.

### Easier Management for your data.
GDSS will allow you to manage your level and application data easily.

And much more!
